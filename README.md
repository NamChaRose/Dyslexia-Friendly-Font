# Dyslexia-Friendly Font
## Overview
This project is an intended font that enhances the readability by those with dyslexia. It has both cursive changes in the appearance of certain letters like the connected parts as well as marks, often a dash below some of the letters that show the difference between letters that are easily confused. Hence, the aim is the improvement of reading comfort and effective reading for people with specific learning disabilities.
## Key Features
### Cursive-style Letters
>- Letters such as b, d, g, h, j, k, l, q and s incorporate cursive elements
>- These letters are quite troublesome for dyslexic readers in that the letter looks like other letters (for example, b and d, g and q, q and p, s and z, u and v, or m and w).
>- The font is given a more elongated (cursive) and flowing appearance to make each of the individual letters more distinctive
### Dash symbol for Differentiation
>- Letters like v and w have a dash beneath them
>- The v with a dash below it is visually separated from u, while the w with a dash helps differentiate it from m.
### Visual Anchoring
>- Dashes below certain letters are used as an anchor, to guide the readers to the right position while identifying a word. This feature is useful where there are long sentences and there is a confusion between two or more letters hence one is likely to read wrong word all together.
### Familiar, Yet Distinct
>- The letters might look stylized but the font used is not so unconventional as to fall far away from traditional kind. This balance makes it possible for the users not to be shocked by drastic changes while still being able to enjoy other changes that make the differentiation possible.
### Font Design tool used
>- [Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/) (an online platform for designing fonts)
