# Dyslexia-Friendly Font
## Overview
This project is an intended font that enhances the readability by those with dyslexia. It has both cursive changes in the appearance of certain letters like the connected parts as well as marks, often a dash below some of the letters that show the difference between letters that are easily confused. Hence, the aim is the improvement of reading comfort and effective reading for people with specific learning disabilities.
## Key Features
### Cursive-style Letters
>Letters such as b, d, g, h, j, k, l, q and s incorporate cursive elements.
>These letters are quite troublesome for dyslexic readers in that the letter looks like other letters (for example, b and d, g and q, q and p, s and z, u and v, or m and w).
>The font is given a more elongated (cursive) and flowing appearance to make each of the individual letters more distinctive.
